Requirements specification
The program will discover all of the fluky numbers from 1 - 10000
It will also read out the time it takes to find them.

System Analysis
The system will use loops to go through 1 - 10000 and discover all the fluky numbers
Once the system gets to 7 fluky numbers it will end the loop since there are only 7 fluky numbers from 1 - 10000

System Design
The program will use the random and the time modules.
